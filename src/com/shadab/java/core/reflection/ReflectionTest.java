/*	Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time. It is also possible to instantiate new objects, invoke methods and get/set field values using reflection.

Java Reflection is quite powerful and can be very useful. For instance, Java Reflection can be used to map properties in JSON files to getter / setter methods in Java objects, like Jackson, GSON, Boon etc. does. Or, Reflection can be used to map the column names of a JDBC ResultSet to getter / setter methods in a Java object.
 * 
 * 
 *    Reflection cant change the code but we can invoke the invokable things and we 
	can explore them. We can instantiate the class .
	Every things available under java.lang.reflect.
	Using Java Reflection you can inspect Java classes at runtime. Inspecting classes is often the first thing you do when using Reflection. From the classes you can obtain information about

Class Name
Class Modifies (public, private, synchronized etc.)
Package Info
Superclass
Implemented Interfaces
Constructors
Methods
Fields
Annotations

We can modify the access modifiers, There is java security(security manager)
 which check whether caller code is authorised or not.
 If we want to disable it we can do it by disabling security manager.
